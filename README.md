# CSCE-314
All projects in CSCE 314. Do not copy code. This course was taken in Summer 2020 with Professor Shawn Lupoli. This course focuses on a functional programming language (**Scheme**; not much documentation on this language. Gambit Scheme was the flavor used for this particular course) and an Object-Orientated programming language (**Java** for this course).

A good video on an introduction to Scheme can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k78c8EctXI). For Java help, **GeeksForGeeks** provides a great platform with plenty of good Java information; the Java page can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/).

## Usage
Most of the code for this project is designed to run in Eclipse. The GUI part of the project was developed on WindowBuilder. Make sure that the WindowBuilder package is installed for your Eclipse version. More information on installing Windowbuilder can be found on **ProgrammingKnowledge**'s youtube channel. A link to a tutorial on the basic installation and setup of Windowbuilder can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeswfZz4IW0&t=489s).
